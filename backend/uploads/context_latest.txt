The Internet of 
Things i. Access to Information6
⮚Information can beaccessed invarious forms, particularly through theInternet .
⮚Web browsers areacommon tool forretrieving information from websites, including social media sites .
⮚Mobile applications onsmartphones also provide access toremote information .
⮚Information available covers awide range oftopics including arts, business, cooking, government, health, history,
hobbies, science, sports, travel, and more .
⮚News organizations areincreasingly moving online, with some ceasing print operations .
⮚Online news isbecoming more personalizable, allowing users tochoose specific interests .
⮚Social media platforms are increasingly curating news, where users can post and share content from various
sources .
⮚The news seen byusers isoften personalized through algorithms based onuser history .
⮚Organizations like ACM and IEEE Computer Society have made their journals and proceedings available
online . Contd..7
⮚Much oftheinformation ontheInternet isaccessed viaaclient -server model .
⮚Inthis model, aclient requests information from aserver, which then responds .
⮚This model iswidely used, including forweb applications, where aserver generates web pages inresponse toclient
requests .
Figure 1: A network with two clients and one 
server
Figure 2: The client -server model involves 
requests and responses Contd..8
Figure 3: In a peer -to-peer system, there are no fixed clients and servers
⮚Peer -to-peer (P2P)communication involves individuals communicating directly without afixed division into
clients and servers .
⮚P2Pcommunication became popular with music sharing services like Napster and isstill used today forlegal
purposes, such assharing public domain music and downloading software . ii. Person -to-Person Communication9
⮚Email iswidely used globally, often including audio, video, text, and pictures .
⮚Instant messaging ispopular, allowing real -time text communication between individuals .
⮚The Internet isused tocarry audio (e.g.,Internet radio, streaming music) and video (e.g.,Netflix, YouTube) .
⮚Internet -based communication can becrucial forthose inremote areas, offering access toservices comparable to
those inurban centers .
⮚Social networks bridge person -to-person communication and information access, driven byuser relationships .
⮚Facebook isaleading social networking site, allowing profile updates and sharing among friends .
⮚People can work together tocreate content, such asthrough wikis .
⮚Wikipedia isthemost famous wiki, allowing anyone toread oredit content, with thousands ofother wikis existing . iii. Electronic Commerce10
⮚Online Shopping :Online shopping ishighly popular, allowing users tobrowse catalogs from thousands of
companies and have products delivered totheir homes .
⮚E-commerce inFinance :People pay bills, manage bank accounts, and handle investments electronically .
⮚Online Auctions :Online auctions forsecond -hand goods have become amassive industry .Unlike traditional e-
commerce, online auctions aremore peer -to-peer, where consumers can beboth buyers and sellers .
⮚Certain forms ofe-commerce have acquired terms ortags based onthe pronunciation similarity between "to"
and "2,"with popular examples listed inthebelow figure .
Figure 4: Some forms of e -commerce iv. Entertainment11
⮚Entertainment athome has advanced significantly with thedistribution ofmusic, radio, TVprograms, and movies
over theInternet .
⮚Users can find, buy, and download MP3songs and high -definition movies toadd totheir personal collections .
⮚Entertainment content can bemoved around thehome between different devices, displays, and speakers, typically
through awireless network .
⮚Inthefuture, itmay bepossible toinstantly search forand display any movie orTVprogram ever made .
⮚New films may become interactive, allowing viewers toinfluence the story direction, with alternative scenarios
provided .
⮚Live television might become interactive, where audiences participate inquiz shows orchoose among contestants .
⮚Multi -person real -time simulation games arealready popular . v. The Internet of Things12
⮚Ubiquitous computing refers tocomputing embedded ineveryday life, asenvisioned byMark Weiser in1991 .
⮚Many homes areequipped with security systems, including door and window sensors, and can integrate additional
sensors forsmart home monitoring .
⮚Smart electricity, gas, and water meters can report usage over thenetwork, eliminating theneed formanual meter
reading .
⮚Smoke detectors can automatically alert thefire department, and smart refrigerators could reorder groceries when
supplies arelow.
⮚The IoT revolution isconnecting nearly every electronic device tothe Internet, enabling more measurement and
reporting through networks . 2. Types of Computer Networks13

Networks i. Broadband Access Networks14
⮚In1977 ,Ken Olsen ofDigital Equipment Corporation claimed there was noneed forpersonal computers at
home, aprediction that proved incorrect asDigital eventually vanished .
⮚Initially used forword processing and games, home computers now primarily provide Internet access .Modern
consumer electronics, including set-top boxes, game consoles, and televisions, feature embedded computers
connected tonetworks .
⮚Home networks arewidely used formanaging entertainment content .Internet access allows users toconnect to
remote computers, access information, communicate, and shop .
⮚Metcalfe’s Law explains theInternet’s popularity bystating itsvalue increases with thesquare ofthenumber of
users .
⮚Broadband access isexpanding globally, with speeds rising togigabit levels indeveloped countries and mobile
access being more common indeveloping regions . ii. Mobile and Wireless Access Networks15
⮚Mobile computers like laptops, tablets, and smartphones are among the fastest -growing segments inthe
computer industry, surpassing desktop sales .
⮚People use these devices for arange ofactivities, including email, social media, streaming media, and web
browsing from virtually anywhere .
⮚Connectivity iscrucial, with wireless networks —cellular and Wi-Fi—providing access inplaces where wired
connections areimpractical, such ascars and airplanes .
⮚Wireless networks also support various applications, from fleet management toride -sharing services .
⮚Additionally, mobile phones, which combine telephony and computing, have become central tomobile
commerce (m-commerce), facilitating payments and transactions viaSMS and NFC technology .
⮚The rise ofmobile technology and wireless networks isdriving innovations like sensor networks and wireless
parking meters, promising torevolutionize both daily lifeand scientific research . Contd..16
Figure 5: Combinations of wireless networks and mobile computing iii. Content provider Networks17
⮚Many Internet services are hosted inlarge "cloud" data centers with thousands ofservers, designed forhigh
data transfer and energy efficiency .
⮚Early data center designs used athree -layer tree topology but had scalability issues .Content Delivery Networks
(CDNs) help deliver content globally byplacing servers close tousers .
⮚Major providers like Google, Facebook, and Netflix operate their own CDNs, while services like Akamai and
Cloudflare offer CDN solutions toothers .
⮚CDNs manage content replication and selection based onproximity, server load, and network congestion . iv. Transit Networks18
⮚The Internet operates over multiple independently managed networks .
⮚Typically, your ISP's network differs from the one hosting website content .Content travels from data -center
networks through transit networks toreach your ISPand device .
⮚Transit networks, historically profitable asbackbone providers, charge ISPs and content providers fortraffic .
⮚Recently, content consolidation with large providers and theexpansion ofaccess ISPs have reduced reliance on
transit networks .
⮚Larger networks now often prefer direct interconnection, using transit networks primarily asabackup . v. Enterprise Networks19
⮚Resource Sharing :Efficiently share physical resources (e.g.,printers) and crucial data across thenetwork .
⮚Remote Access :Enable access todata and applications from various locations, overcoming geographical barriers .
⮚Enhanced Communication :Facilitate email, IPtelephony, video conferencing, and desktop sharing toimprove
collaboration and reduce travel .
⮚Electronic Business :Conduct transactions and manage orders online tostreamline operations and reduce
inventory . 3. Network Topology, From Local to Global 20

⮚Personal Area Networks (PANs) enable short -range communication between devices, such asconnecting a
computer toperipherals orlinking wireless headphones and smartphones .
⮚Bluetooth isacommon PAN technology that simplifies these connections without cables, using amaster -slave model
where thePCmanages other devices .
⮚Other short -range communication technologies arealso available and will bediscussed further .
Figure 6: Bluetooth PAN configuration ii. Local Area Networks23
⮚Local Area Networks (LANs) are private networks used within abuilding, such ashomes oroffices, toconnect and
share resources like printers and information among computers and electronics .
⮚Wireless LANs, popular invarious settings, use radio modems and antennas tocommunicate with Access Points
(APs) orrouters, which relay packets between devices and theInternet .
⮚Mesh networks, where devices relay packets forone another, arecommon indeveloping regions and large homes .
⮚The IEEE 802 .11standard, commonly known asWiFi, supports speeds from 11Mbps to7Gbps .
⮚Wired LANs, using technologies like copper, coaxial cable, and optical fiber, generally offer higher speeds (100 Mbps
to40Gbps), lower latency, and fewer errors compared towireless LANs .
⮚Ethernet, governed byIEEE 802 .3,isthe most common wired LAN type, using switches torelay packets between
connected computers .
⮚Ethernet switches use ananti -looping algorithm tomanage packet routing effectively . Contd..24
⮚LANs can bedivided into logical networks, called VLANs (Virtual LANs), tomatch organizational structures .
⮚VLANs allow fortraffic separation within aphysical LAN, enhancing management .
⮚Traditional Ethernet used asingle linear cable forbroadcasting packets, while modern switched Ethernet does not.
⮚Resource allocation inLANs can bestatic ordynamic, with dynamic methods being centralized (controlled bya
single entity) ordecentralized (where each machine manages itstransmission) .
Figure 7: Wireless and wired LANs (a) 802.11 (b) Switched Ethernet
 iii. Home Networks25
⮚Home networks, atype ofLAN, connect awide range ofInternet -enabled devices, including smartphones, smart
appliances, and security systems .
⮚They must beuser -friendly, secure, and reliable due tothediverse and growing number ofconnected devices .
⮚Wireless networks are commonly used fortheir convenience and low cost but face challenges like performance
bottlenecks and security risks .
⮚With devices evolving organically and needing tointeroperate, ensuring compatibility and security while keeping
costs low iscrucial .
⮚Power -line networks areanalternative forextending connectivity but come with their own limitations iv. Metropolitan Area Network 26
⮚AMetropolitan Area Network (MAN) covers anentire city and includes systems like cable television networks .
⮚Originally, these networks were used forTVreception via community antennas but evolved toinclude Internet
service byutilizing unused parts ofthespectrum .
⮚Cable TVsystems transformed into MANs byproviding both television and Internet services .
⮚Another example ofaMAN isWiMAX (IEEE 802 .16),ahigh -speed wireless Internet technology, though ithas not
become widespread .
⮚Other wireless technologies, such asLTE and 5G,also serve asMANs .
Figure 8: A metropolitan area network based on cable TV v. Wide Area Networks27
⮚AWide Area Network (WAN) spans large areas like countries or
continents, connecting multiple locations .Itincludes :
1.Subnet :The communication part ofthe WAN, consisting of
transmission lines (e.g.,fiber, copper) and routers that direct data
traffic .
2.Routing and Forwarding :Routers determine the best data paths
and send packets totheir destinations .
3.Management :InWANs, hosts and the subnet are often managed
separately, with WANs connecting different networking technologies
and sometimes entire LANs .
4.Internetworks :Many WANs combine various networks and
technologies into one system .Figure 9: A metropolitan area 
network based on cable TV

private network vi. Internetworks30
⮚Toconnect different networks, which often use various hardware and software technologies, aninternetwork (or
internet )iscreated .This term generally refers toacollection ofinterconnected networks, asopposed tothespecific
global Internet .
⮚Internetworks :These connect distinct networks, such asLANs and WANs, ortwo LANs, often involving different
technologies .
⮚Gateways :Devices that connect networks and handle necessary translations arecalled gateways .
⮚Routers :These arenetwork -layer gateways that direct packets between networks .Large networks often use many
routers tomanage data traffic . 4. Examples of Networks 31

⮚Itisabbreviated as“Advanced Research Project AgencyNetwork” .
⮚Inmid 60’sDepartment ofDefense (DoD) started ARPANET tobuild anetwork that could resist any attacks from
USSR and help academicians share research .
⮚ARPANET used thepacket -switching technology tointerconnect four nodes .
⮚Hence DoD divided thenetwork into subnets and host computers .
⮚The subnet software consisted oftheIMP end ofthehost -IMP connection, theIMP -IMP protocol, and asource IMP to
destination IMP protocol designed toimprove reliability .
⮚Subnet would consist ofminicomputers called“Interface Message Processors” (IMPs) connected bytransmission
lines .
Figure 12: WAN using an ISP network ii. NFSNET34
⮚Bythe late 1970 s,the NSF recognized the value ofARPANET forresearch but needed abroader network .In1981 ,
NSF funded CSNET toconnect computer science departments toARPANET .
⮚Later, they developed NSFNET, connecting sixsupercomputers with TCP/IP, marking the first large -scale TCP/IP
network .
⮚AsNSFNET expanded, ittransitioned tocommercial operation, leading tothecreation ofANS and multiple NAPs to
support competitive internet services .
⮚This shift laid the foundation forthe modern Internet .The World Wide Web's rise inthe 1990 sfueled exponential
growth, with theInternet now dominated bystreaming and social media, drastically increasing traffic and reshaping
itsarchitecture
Figure 13: The NSFNET backbone in 
1988 iii. The Internet Architecture35
⮚The Internet's architecture has evolved significantly due togrowth and industry convergence, such as"triple play"
services .
⮚Ahome computer connects totheInternet through anISP, often viacable (HFC networks) orfiber (FTTH) .
⮚ISPs operate POPs (Points ofPresence) forpacket entry, and they connect atIXPs (Internet Exchange Points) to
exchange traffic .
⮚Peering agreements between ISPs determine packet paths, with tier-1ISPs like AT&T forming the backbone ofthe
Internet .
⮚Content providers, such asFacebook and Netflix, host servers indata centers, often directly connected toISPs,
bypassing traditional hierarchies .
⮚The rise of"hyper -giant" content providers and CDNs has flattened the Internet's architecture, allowing direct
connections between access ISPs and content providers . b. Mobile Networks36
⮚Mobile networks have over five billion subscribers, about 65%ofthe global population, with most having Internet
access ontheir devices .
⮚In2018 ,mobile Internet traffic surpassed half ofglobal online traffic, making the study ofmobile phone systems
essential .

⮚The architecture ofmobile phone networks, particularly 4GLTE, differs significantly from theInternet .
⮚The radio communication protocol between mobile devices and base stations, known asE-UTRAN, forms the
wireless side, while thecore network, EPC (Evolved Packet Core), handles data traffic .
⮚Mobile networks have evolved tofully packet -switched systems, supporting higher data rates than earlier
generations .
⮚Mobility ismanaged through handovers between base stations, ensuring seamless connectivity .
⮚Security isalso apriority, with SIM cards used forauthentication and encryption, providing better privacy than
earlier systems . Mobile Network Architecture38

 ii. Packet Switching and Circuit Switching40
Circuit Switching Packet Switching
In-circuit switching has there are 3 phases:
i) Connection Establishment.
ii) Data Transfer.
iii) Connection Released.In Packet switching directly data transfer takes place.
Here, each data unit knows the entire path address 
which is provided by the source.Here, each data unit just knows the final destination 
address intermediate path is decided by the routers.
In-Circuit switching, data is processed at the source 
system onlyIn Packet switching, data is processed at all 
intermediate nodes including the source system.
The delay between data units in circuit switching is 
uniform.The delay between data units in packet switching is not 
uniform.
Circuit switching is more reliable. Packet switching is less reliable.
Wastage of resources is more in Circuit Switching.Less wastage of resources as compared to Circuit 
Switching.
It is not a store and forward technique. It is a store and forward technique. iii. Early Generation Mobile Networks: 1G, 2G, and 3G41
⮚Mobile networks have evolved significantly over 50years :
▪1G(e.g.,AMPS, 1982 ):Used analog signals forvoice .
▪2G(e.g.,GSM, 1991 ):Introduced digital voice and text messaging .
▪3G(e.g.,UMTS, 2001 ):Added broadband data services with speeds upto14Mbps downlink .
⮚Tomanage radio spectrum scarcity, mobile networks use acellular design that reuses frequencies while minimizing
interference .Spectrum licensing, often through expensive auctions, iscrucial fornetwork operation . iv. Modern Mobile Networks: 4G and 5G42
Future mobile networks arefocused onmobile broadband rather than just voice calls .
⮚4GLTE :Launched inthelate 2000 s,offering faster speeds and became dominant over alternatives like WiMAX .
⮚5G:Setforearly 2020 s,promises speeds upto10Gbps and operates athigher frequencies (up to6GHz) .Higher
frequencies face challenges such asshorter signal range and increased susceptibility tointerference and weather
conditions .Toaddress these, 5Guses advanced technologies like MIMO antennas and improved algorithms . c. Wireless Networks (WiFi)43
⮚The IEEE 802 .11standard, developed inthe mid -1990 s,unified wireless LANs, addressing earlier compatibility
issues .
⮚Operating inunlicensed ISM bands, itavoids thecost oflicensed spectrum but faces potential interference .
⮚The standard includes infrastructure mode with access points and adhoc mode fordirect client communication .
⮚Itevolved from initial speeds of1-2Mbps to54Mbps with 802 .11a/g, and now supports upto3.5Gbps with
802 .11acand 7Gbps with 802 .11ad,though thelatter islimited toindoor use.
⮚Ituses CSMA formanaging interference and collisions, with security improving from WEP toWPA 2and WPA 3.
⮚Today, 802 .11iswidespread, extending tovarious devices and vehicles, and integrating with technologies like LTE -

AllocationEvolvability Security i. Reliability46
⮚Reliability involves ensuring thenetwork operates correctly despite unreliable components .Bits inapacket may be
damaged due tonoise, signals, orfaults .
⮚Error detection codes can identify errors, and retransmission ensures correct receipt .
⮚Error correction codes can recover theoriginal message from incorrect bits.
⮚These methods use redundant information and areapplied both atlow layers forindividual links and high layers for
overall data integrity .
⮚Another issue isfinding aworking path through thenetwork .
⮚Multiple paths often exist, and some links orrouters may bedown .
⮚For example, ifthenetwork isdown inBerlin, packets from London toRome can bererouted through Paris .
⮚This process isknown asrouting, which thenetwork should handle automatically . ii. Resource Allocation47
⮚Inlarge networks, challenges similar tocity traffic jams and shortages arise .Scalable designs continue towork well
asnetworks grow .Networks manage resources like transmission line capacity toensure one hostdoesn’t interfere
toomuch with another .
⮚Statistical multiplexing isamethod where network bandwidth isshared dynamically based onshort -term demand,
rather than fixed allocations .This can beapplied atboth low and high layers .
⮚Flow control addresses the issue offast senders overwhelming slow receivers, typically through feedback
mechanisms .Congestion occurs when too many devices demand more resources than the network can provide,
leading tostrategies forreducing demand during overload .
⮚Beyond bandwidth, networks must also address timeliness forreal -time applications .Quality ofservice mechanisms
balance real -time delivery with high throughput needs . iii. Evolvability48
⮚Another design issue isnetwork evolution .Asnetworks grow and new designs emerge, they need toconnect with
existing infrastructure .
⮚Protocol layering isakey strategy formanaging change bydividing theproblem and hiding implementation details .
⮚Additionally, each layer requires addressing ornaming mechanisms toidentify message senders and receivers .
⮚Different network technologies have varied limitations .
⮚For instance, some channels donotpreserve message order, requiring numbering solutions .
⮚Variations inmaximum message size necessitate mechanisms forbreaking down, transmitting, and reassembling
messages .
⮚This overall process isknown asinternetworking . iv. Security49
⮚The final major design issue isnetwork security .
⮚Key threats include eavesdropping oncommunications .
⮚Confidentiality mechanisms protect against this byensuring data privacy across multiple layers .
⮚Authentication mechanisms prevent impersonation, helping todistinguish legitimate sites and verify caller
identities .
⮚Integrity mechanisms guard against unauthorized changes tomessages, such asaltering transaction amounts . b. Protocol Layering50
⮚Tomanage design complexity, networks use alayered structure, where each layer builds ontheone below it.
⮚The number, names, functions, and contents oflayers vary bynetwork .
⮚Each layer provides services tothelayer above while hiding implementation details .
⮚This concept, known asinformation hiding orencapsulation, iscommon incomputer science .
⮚When layers ondifferent machines communicate, they follow specific rules and conventions known asthelayer’s
protocol .
⮚Aprotocol isanagreement onhow communication should proceed .For example, insocial interactions, thechoice of
greeting depends onthecontext, similar tohow adhering toprotocol ensures effective communication . Contd..51
⮚The entities comprising the corresponding layers on
different machines are called peers .The peers may be
software processes, hardware devices, or even human
beings .
⮚Between each pair ofadjacent layers isaninterface .The
interface defines which primitive operations and services the
lower layer makes available totheupper one.
⮚Aset of layers and protocols iscalled anetwork
architecture .
⮚Alistoftheproto cols used byacertain system, one protocol
per layer, iscalled aprotocol stack .

ServiceReliability i. Connection -Oriented Service53
⮚Connection -oriented service isrelated tothe telephone system .Itincludes connection establishment and
connection termination .Inaconnection -oriented service, theHandshake method isused toestablish theconnection
between sender and receiver .
 ii. Connectionless Service54
⮚Connection -less service isrelated tothe postal system .Itdoes not include any connection establishment and
connection termination .Connection -less Service does not give aguarantee ofreliability .Inthis, Packets donot
follow the same path toreach their destination .There are different names formessages indifferent contexts ;a
packet isamessage atthenetwork layer .When theintermediate nodes receive amessage infullbefore sending iton
tothenext node, this iscalled store -and -forward switching .
 Differences55
Connection Oriented Service Connectionless Service
It is related to the telephone system. It is related to the postal system.
Connection -oriented service is preferred by long and 
steady communication.Connection -less Service is preferred by bursty 
communication.
In connection -oriented Service, Congestion is not 
possible.In connection -less Service, Congestion is possible.
Connection -oriented Service gives the guarantee of 
reliability.Connection -less Service does not give a guarantee of 
reliability.
In connection -oriented Service, Packets follow the 
same route.In connection -less Service, Packets do not follow the 
same route.
Connection -oriented requires authentication.Connection -less Service does not require 
authentication. iii. Reliability56
⮚Connection -oriented and connectionless services can each becharacterized bytheir reliability .Some services are
reliable inthe sense that they never lose data .Usually, areliable service isimplemented byhaving the receiver
acknowledge the receipt ofeach message sothe sender issure that itarrived .The acknowledgement process
introduces overhead and delays, which areoften worth itbut sometimes theprice that has tobepaid forreliability
istoohigh .
Figure 17: Six different types of service d. Service Primitives57
⮚Aservice isformally specified byasetofprimitives (operations) available touser processes toaccess theservice .
⮚These primitives telltheservice toperform some action orreport onanaction taken byapeer entity .

using acknowledged datagrams
 e. The Relationship of Services to Protocols59
⮚Aprotocol, incontrast, isasetofrules governing the format and meaning ofthe packets, ormessages that are
exchanged bythepeer entities within alayer .Entities use protocols inorder toimplement their service definitions .
They arefree tochange their protocols atwill, provided they donot change theservice visible totheir users .Inthis
way, theservice and theprotocol arecompletely decoupled .This isakey concept that any network designer should
understand well .

⮚Itiscalled the ISO OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Reference Model because itdeals with connecting open
systems—that is,systems that areopen forcommunication with other systems .
⮚The OSI model has seven layers .The principles that were applied toarrive atthe seven layers can bebriefly
summarized asfollows :
1.Alayer should becreated where adifferent abstraction isneeded .
2.Each layer should perform awell -defined function .
3.The function ofeach layer should bechosen with aneye toward defining internationally standardized protocols .
4.The layer boundaries should bechosen tominimize theinformation flow across theinterfaces .
5.The number oflayers should belarge enough that distinct functions need not bethrown together inthesame layer
outofnecessity and small enough that thearchitecture does notbecome unwieldy .
⮚Three concepts arecentral totheOSI model :
1.Services
2.Interfaces
3.Protocols Physical Layer66
⮚Deals with allaspects ofphysically moving data from one computer tothenext
⮚Converts data from theupper layers into 1sand 0sfortransmission over media
⮚Defines how data isencoded onto themedia totransmit thedata
⮚Defined onthis layer :Cable standards, wireless standards, and fiber optic standards .
⮚Copper wiring, fiber optic cable, radio frequencies, anything that can beused totransmit data isdefined onthe
Physical layer oftheOSI Model
⮚Device example :Hub
⮚Used totransmit data Data Link Layer67
⮚Isresponsible formoving frames from node tonode orcomputer tocomputer
⮚Can move frames from one adjacent computer toanother, cannot move frames across routers
⮚Encapsulation =frame
⮚Requires MAC address orphysical address
⮚Protocols defined include Ethernet Protocol and Point -to-Point Protocol (PPP)
⮚Device example :Switch
⮚Two sublayers :Logical Link Control (LLC) and theMedia Access Control (MAC)
✔Logical Link Control (LLC)–Data Link layer addressing, flow control, address notification, error control
✔Media Access Control (MAC)–Determines which computer has access tothe network media atany given time .
Determines where one frame ends and thenext one starts, called frame synchronization Network Layer68
⮚Responsible formoving packets (data) from one end ofthenetwork totheother, called end-to-end communications
⮚Requires logical addresses such asIPaddresses
⮚Device example :Router
⮚Routing isthe ability ofvarious network devices and their related software tomove data packets from source to
destination Transport Layer69
⮚Takes data from higher levels ofOSI Model and breaks itinto segments that can besent tolower -level layers for
data transmission
⮚Conversely, reassembles data segments into data that higher -level protocols and applications can use
⮚Also puts segments incorrect order (called sequencing )sothey can bereassembled incorrect order atdestination
⮚Concerned with thereliability ofthetransport ofsent data
⮚May use aconnection -oriented protocol such asTCP toensure destination received segments
⮚May use aconnectionless protocol such asUDP tosend segments without assurance ofdelivery
⮚Uses port addressing Session Layer70
⮚Responsible formanaging thedialog between networked devices
⮚Establishes, manages, and terminates connections
⮚Provides duplex, half-duplex, orsimplex communications between devices
⮚Provides procedures forestablishing checkpoints, adjournment, termination, and restart orrecovery procedures Presentation Layer71
⮚Concerned with how data ispresented tothenetwork
⮚Handles three primary tasks :–Translation ,–Compression ,–Encryption
•Changes data soanother type ofcomputer can
understand it
 Translation
•Makes data smaller tosend more data insame amount
oftime
 Compression
•Encodes data toprotect from interception oreaves

⮚Contains allservices orprotocols needed byapplication software oroperating system tocommunicate onthe
network
⮚Examples
✔Firefox web browser uses HTTP (Hyper -Text Transport Protocol)
✔E-mail program may use POP 3(Post Office Protocol version 3)toread e-mails and SMTP (Simple Mail Transport
Protocol) tosend e-mails Video –4 –TCP/IP MODEL73

 The Link Layer76
⮚The lowest layer inthemodel, thelink layer, describes what links such asserial lines and classic Ethernet must doto
meet theneeds ofthis connectionless internet layer .
The Internet Layer
⮚Itsjobistopermit hosts toinject packets into any network and have them travel independently tothedestination .
⮚The internet layer defines anofficial packet format and protocol called IP(Internet Protocol), plus acompanion
protocol called ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) that helps itfunction .
⮚The joboftheinternet layer istodeliver IPpackets where they aresupposed togo. The Transport Layer77
⮚Two end to-end transport protocols have been defined here .The first one, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), isa
reliable connection -oriented protocol that allows abyte stream originating onone machine tobedelivered without
error onany other machine intheinternet .Itsegments theincoming byte stream into discrete messages and passes
each one ontothe internet layer .Atthe destination, the receiving TCP process reassembles the received messages
into theoutput stream .
⮚UDP (User Datagram Protocol), isanunreliable, connectionless protocol forapplications that donot wantTCP’s
sequencing orflow control and wish toprovide their own (ifany) .Itisalso widely used forone-shot, client -server -
type request -reply queries and applications inwhich prompt delivery ismore important than accurate delivery,
such astransmitting speech orvideo . The Application Layer78
⮚Application layer include any session and presentation functions that they require .
⮚Itcontains allthehigher -level protocols .The early ones included virtual terminal (TELNET), filetrans fer(FTP), and
electronic mail (SMTP) .Many other protocols have been added tothese over theyears .

 Differences80
OSI Model TCP/ IP Model
Contains 7 layers. Contains 4 layers.
Uses Strict layering resulting in vertical layers. Uses Loose layering resulting in Horizontal layers.
Supports both connectionless and connection -oriented 
communication in Network layer, but only connection -
oriented communication in transport layer.Supports only connectionless communication in 
Network layer, but both connection -oriented and 
connectionless communication in transport layer.
It distinguishes between Service, Interface and 
Protocol.Does not clearly distinguishes between Service, 
Interface and Protocol.
It does not support internet working. It supports internet working.
Considered more reliable. Considered a reference model. Video –6 -Encapsulation81

 7. Standardization 83
⮚The Internet, with its roots primarily in the research domain.
⮚Various groups that coordinate Internet issues have guided this growth and development.
Figure 24: Internet Administration Internet Society (ISOC)84
⮚ISOC isaninternational, nonprofit organization formed in1992 to provide support forthe Internet standards
process .
⮚ISOC accomplishes this through maintaining and supporting other Internet administrative bodies such asIAB,IETF,
IRTF, and IANA .
⮚Also promotes research and other scholarly activities relating totheInternet . Internet Architecture Board (IAB)85
⮚The IAB isthetechnical advisor totheISOC .
⮚Purposes :
✔oversee thecontinuing development oftheTCP/IP Protocol Suite .
✔serve inatechnical advisory capacity toresearch members oftheInternet community .
⮚IAB accomplishes this through its two primary components:  
1.Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
2.Internet Research Task Force (IRTF).
⮚Another responsibility of the IAB is the editorial management of the RFCs. Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF )86
⮚Forum ofworking groups managed bytheInternet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) .
⮚Responsible foridentifying operational problems and proposing solutions tothese problems .
⮚Also develops and reviews specifications intended asInternet standards .
⮚Forum ofworking groups managed bySteering Group (IRSG) .
⮚Itfocus onlong -term research topics related toInternet protocols, applications, architecture and technology .Internet Research Task Force (IRTF ) W3C87
⮚For Web standards, theWorld Wide Web Consortium (W3C)develops protocols and guidelines tofacilitate thelong -
term growth oftheWeb .
⮚W3Cnow has almost 500 companies, universities, and other organizations asmembers and has produced well over
100 W3CRecommendations, asitsstandards arecalled, covering topics such asHTML and Web privacy . END OF MODULE 188
