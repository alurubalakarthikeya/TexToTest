    Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, 
    one of the two pillars of modern physics. His work is also known for its influence on the 
    philosophy of science. He was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire, 
    on 14 March 1879. Einstein received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to 
    theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect, 
    a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.
    
    Isaac Newton was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, theologian, and author who 
    is widely recognised as one of the greatest mathematicians and physicists of all time. 
    He was born on 4 January 1643 in Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, Lincolnshire, England. 
    Newton formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that formed the dominant 
    scientific viewpoint until it was superseded by the theory of relativity.
